# roadmap (by claude)
Month 1-2:

1. Read "Blockchain Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction in 25 Steps" by Daniel Drescher (Estimated time: 2-3 weeks)
2. Complete the first two courses of the "Blockchain Specialization" on Coursera (Estimated time: 4-5 weeks, 3-5 hours per week)

Month 3: 3. Read "Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and DApps" by Antonopoulos and Wood (Estimated time: 4-5 weeks)

4. Start working through CryptoZombies lessons (Estimated time: 1-2 hours per week, ongoing)

Month 4: 5. Read "Programming Bitcoin: Learn How to Program Bitcoin from Scratch" by Jimmy Song (Estimated time: 3-4 weeks)

6. Continue CryptoZombies lessons

Month 5: 7. Work through the Solidity documentation, focusing on areas relevant to your interests (Estimated time: 2-3 weeks)

8. Start a small personal project using what you've learned (Estimated time: Ongoing)

Throughout:

- Dedicate time each week to explore the Ethereum Wiki on GitHub
- Join blockchain developer communities on platforms like Discord or Reddit to stay updated and ask questions

This roadmap assumes you can dedicate about 10-15 hours per week to blockchain studies alongside your university coursework. You can adjust the pace based on your schedule and learning speed.

The plan starts with a general overview, moves to Ethereum-specific content, then covers Bitcoin for a broader perspective. It includes both theoretical learning and practical coding.
