Unsigned types can be prone to bugs best to avoid them, in C++ when comparing a signed integer to unsigned, it gets converted to unsigned which can lead to unexpecte
int type can be either 2 or 4 bytes long depending on the machine, to have certainty over the range of the variable you can use `cstdint` header that includes types which are sure to be of the specified length: 
<table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Range</th><th>Notes</th></tr><tr><td>std::int8_t</td><td>1 byte signed</td><td>-128 to 127</td><td>Treated like a signed char on many systems. See note below.</td></tr><tr><td>std::uint8_t</td><td>1 byte unsigned</td><td>0 to 255</td><td>Treated like an unsigned char on many systems.
