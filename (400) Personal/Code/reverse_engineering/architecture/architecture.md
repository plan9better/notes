RISC vs CISC:
- RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer example is RISC-V and [[ARM]]
- CISC stands for Complex Instruction Set Computer, intel [[x86]], [[x64]] and amd processors are all CISC. 

CISC has more instructions which are not necessary but are there to speed up some common operations. For example some [[syscalls]] and [[Software Interrupt]]s are converted to CPU operations.
