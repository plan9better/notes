```"The act of thinking through (and writing) the test code helps clarify your thoughts about what the method itself needs to do. As soon as your implementation code is done, you already have test code just waiting to validate it. Besides, you know if you don’t do it now, you’ll never do it. There’s always something more interesting to do. Ideally, write a little test code, then write only the implementation code you need in order to pass that test. Then write a little more test code and write only the new implementation code needed to pass that new test. At each test iteration, you run all the previously written tests to prove that your latest code additions don’t break previously tested code"```

- Write the test code first
- Develop in iteration cycles
- Keep the code simple
- Improve when you notice the opportunity
- Don't release until it passes tests
- Don't put in anything that's not the spec
- Work regular hours
