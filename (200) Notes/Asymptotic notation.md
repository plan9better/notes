**Asymptotic Notation** is a way to describe how the performance of an algorithm changes as the input size grows. It helps us understand the efficiency of an algorithm without needing exact details. The three most common types are:

1. **[[O notation]]**: Describes the worst-case scenario—how long an algorithm *could* take.
2. **[[Omega notation|Ω notation]]**: Describes the best-case scenario—how quickly an algorithm *could* finish.
3. **[[Theta notation|Θ notation]]**: Describes the average-case scenario—how long an algorithm *usually* takes.

These notations are key in [[Algorithm Analysis|analyzing algorithms]] to predict their scalability with larger inputs.
