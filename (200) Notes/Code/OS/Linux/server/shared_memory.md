Shared memory is a portion of memory that can be accessed by multiple programs. It's often used for inter-process communication and can improve performance in certain scenarios. However, if not properly secured, it can be a security risk.

When we talk about securing shared memory, we're primarily concerned with preventing two types of attacks:

1. Code execution attacks: An attacker might try to place malicious code in shared memory and then execute it.
2. Information disclosure: Sensitive data left in shared memory by one process might be read by another unauthorized process.

The step I mentioned for securing shared memory involves modifying the /etc/fstab file to mount the /run/shm directory (which is used for shared memory) with specific options:
`tmpfs /run/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid 0 0`
Let's break down these options:

- tmpfs: This is a temporary filesystem that resides in memory.
- defaults: This applies the default mount options.
- noexec: This prevents the execution of any binaries on this mount point.
- nosuid: This prevents the use of setuid/setgid bits, which are special permissions that allow users to run executables with the permissions of the executable's owner.

By applying these options, we:

1. Prevent the execution of any code placed in shared memory (noexec).
2. Prevent privilege escalation via setuid/setgid programs in shared memory (nosuid).

This significantly reduces the risk of an attacker using shared memory as an attack vector, while still allowing legitimate use of shared memory for inter-process communication.

After adding this line to /etc/fstab, you would typically reboot the system or remount the filesystem for the changes to take effect:
`mount -o remount /run/shm`
