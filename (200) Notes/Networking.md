[[Router]]:

1. GL.iNet GL-AR750S-Ext (Slate) - This affordable travel router runs OpenWrt, allowing for advanced security configurations and VPN support.
2. Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X - A bit more advanced, great for learning enterprise-level security features on a budget.

[[switch]]:

1. TP-Link TL-SG108E (8-port) or TL-SG105E (5-port) - These smart managed switches allow VLAN configuration and port mirroring, useful for security monitoring.

[[Firewall]]/Security Appliance: Instead of a hub, consider a dedicated security appliance:

1. PC Engines APU2 board - Can be used to build a custom firewall/router running pfSense or OPNsense.

Additional recommendations:

1. Raspberry Pi 4 - Can be used as a network monitoring device or for running security tools like Snort or Suricata.
2. Used enterprise equipment - Look for older Cisco ASA firewalls for learning advanced security concepts.

Security-focused setup ideas:

1. Set up VLANs to segregate network traffic.
2. Implement strong firewall rules and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
3. Configure a VPN for secure remote access.
4. Set up network monitoring and logging for security analysis.
5. Practice hardening techniques on all devices.
6. Experiment with honeypots to learn about threat detection.

Remember, the goal is to learn, so don't worry if you can't implement enterprise-grade security immediately. Start with basic security practices and gradually increase complexity as you learn.
