Dynamical system is a [System](System.md) which changes with time. It consists of more than a space of states but also a [Dynamical law](Dynamical%20law.md) (law of motion).

When a system has more than 1 cycle or can go into 2 seperate "*branches*" we make use of the [[Conservation law]] to describe it.
