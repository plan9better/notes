Prim's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the [[Minimum spanning trees]] of a graph. It is super simple.
### Steps
1. Choose a vertice
2. Choose a lowest cost edge connected to one of your already connected vertices.
3. Add the vertice that edge connects to to your list of connected vertices.
So in plain english just grow your tree from a single point always choosing the lowest cost edge and adding it to the tree.
