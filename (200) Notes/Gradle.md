Kind of like [[make]] but for java. Automates compiling, running, dependency management, testing and deploying
- It uses build_scripts written in groovy or kotlin to define project structure and build process the main one is called [[Gradle Build file]].
- Automatically downloads and manages dependencies
- Splits the work into tasks
- Supports plugins, for minecraft there is a forge gradle plugin.
