Data structures and algorithms are essential components in computer science, focusing on efficient problem-solving. [[Asymptotic notation]], is used to analyze algorithm efficiency. [[Algorithm design techniques]] such as [[Divide and conquer]], [[Dynamic programming]], and [[Greedy algorithms]] provide strategies for tackling challenging problems. [[Graph algorithms]], including those for [[Minimum spanning trees]], [[Shortest paths]], and [[Maximum flow]], are vital for network-related issues. Understanding [[NP-completeness]] is key to grasping computational complexity. These concepts form the foundation of [[Algorithm analysis]] and advanced [[Computer science]], enabling the development of efficient solutions to complex computational problems.
