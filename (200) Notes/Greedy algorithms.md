Greedy algorithms are algorithms that can be broken down to a series of choices([[Divide and conquer]]), each choice is the locally optimal decision at that point with the hope that it will lead to a globally optimal solution. (Often called [[Dynamic programming]] in terms of [[Computer science]])

Examples include:
- [[Shortest paths]]
    - [[Djikstras algorithm]]
    - [[Bellman-Ford algorithm]]
- [[Minimum spanning trees]]
    - [[Prims algorithm]]
    - [[Kruskals algorithm]]
