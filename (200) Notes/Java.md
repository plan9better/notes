- JDK for dev
- JRE for running
- JDK includes JRE
- Gets compiled into bytecode which is then run by JVM.
- Garbage Colleced
    - Objects are created on the heap. Java's heap is garbage collectible so [[JVM]] automatically allocates memory and frees that memory when it sees that an object can no longer be used.
    - After creating an object if you set the only referance to that object to `null` the object is then eligible for garbage collection since it no longer can be accessed
- Main method is the entry to the app, an app must have a psvm method.
- Compile a .java file to .class with `%javac` and run it with `%java`, you need to have JDK to compile
- More about [Types in Java](Types%20(Java).md)
- 2 options of a build system: [[Maven]] and [Gradle](Gradle.md)
