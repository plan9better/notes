$\sigma^2$ Describes the spread between numbers in a dataset.
Measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and thus from every other numver in the set. Used by market analysts and traders to determine [[Market volatility]].
$$\sigma^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\overline{x})^2}{N}$$
## example
if returns for stock in Company ABC are 10% in Year 1, 20% in Year 2, and -15% in Year3, the average of these three returns is: 
$$\frac{}{}$$
(10% + 20% + -15%) / 3 = 5%
