$\sigma^2$ Describes the spread between numbers in a dataset.
Measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and thus from every other numver in the set. Used by market analysts and traders to determine [[Market volatility]].
$$\sigma^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\overline{x})^2}{N}$$
## example
if returns for stock in Company ABC are 10% in Year 1, 20% in Year 2, and -15% in Year3, the average of these three returns is: 
$$\frac{10\% + 20\% + (-15\%)}{3} = 5\%$$
1. differences:
$10\% - 5\% = 5\%$
$20\% - 5\% = 15\%$
$-15\% - 5\% = -20\%$
2. squaring:
$0.25\%$
$2.25\%$
$4.00\%$
3. final:
Variance = $0.25\% + 2.25\% + 4.00\% = 6.5\%$
divide by N - 1
$\frac{6.5\%}{3 - 1} = 3.25\% = 0.0324$

to take the [[Standard deviation]] just take the square root of the variance.
