It is a type of [[Gaussian distribution]] that takes into account multiple variables.

Multivariate gaussian distribution is defined by a covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and mean vector $\mu$. $\mu$ is the diagnal of $\Sigma$ and  represents the variance ($\sigma^2$) of the i'th variable.

The off diagonal values $\sigma_{ij}$ represent the correlation between $i$'th and $j$'th random variables. 
- Positive - the values grow together
- Negative - the values grow oposite to eachother ( one grows the other goes negative)
- Zero - the values have no corelation to eachother.
