In classical physics we know everything about a system at a given point in time, and with that knowledge we can know for certain what will happen to the [State of the system](State%20of%20a%20system).

We try to think of a system as cointinous and not diescrete but sometimes there is no continous way to get from one state to another (Like in examples in [State of a system](State%20of%20a%20system.md). Then we have to think of it as discrete. 

Systems can be [Dynamical](Dynamical%20system.md).
