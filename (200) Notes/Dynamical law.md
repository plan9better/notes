Dynamical law or a law of motion is a rule that tells us the next state given the current state.

e.g. The next state could be the same as current state so with the example of  a coin on a table there are 2 possible histories
1. $\{H, H, H, H, \dots\}$
2. $\{T, T, T, T, T, \dots\}$
Or it could be the oposite:
1. $\{H, T, H, T, H, \dots\}$

If the system is dynamical that means there is some variable that describes it. Such a [variable](State%20variables.md) is called $\sigma$.

A valid dynamical law also has to be *reversible* as well as *deterministic*, that means that we can know for sure the history of the state given the current state. There is no ambiguity, When described as objects with arrows there are no 2 arrows going to or from any object.
