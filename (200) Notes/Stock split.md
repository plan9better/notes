Company splitting a single share into multiple to lower it's price. e.g. nvidia costs 1,200$ does a 10:1 stock split. Now everyone with 1 nvidia share have 10 of them and each share costs 120$.

stock splits often result in short-term abnormal returns. avg 2% to 4% increase in value around the split announcement. so after announcement stock tends to be overpriced relative to its fundamental value. ~Announcement premium

The opposite happens for reverse stock splits (10:1 -> 1:10)
