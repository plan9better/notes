also knows as bytecode and machine code.

CPU has a mapping of machine code (binary or hex)  to actions and registers.
For example a series of `0xf 0x02 0x83` could map to [[Asm]] instructions `add ebx, 0x83`.
But the same instruction (e.g. `add`) does not always have to be represented by the same hex value
