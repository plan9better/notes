### TODO:
- Go through uni lab's again and note down what each service is good for, when to use them, when to avoid them and how to use them.

#### AWS
- [[Athena]]: a service to quickly query data from [[S3]] buckets with sql. Also integrates well with [[Glue Crawler]] for automatically creating columns.
- [[S3]]: Cloud object storage, fast and simple with options for long-term low-access rate storage with **Glacier**.
- [[RDS]]: Relational databases, both classic mysql / postgresql and newer serverless [[Aurora]] versions.
- [DynamoDB](DynamoDB)
