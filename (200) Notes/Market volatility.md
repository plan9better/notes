Statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. Often measured from the [[Standard deviation]] or [[Variance]] between those returns. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk.

e.g. If the stock market rises and falls more than 1% over a sustained period of time it is called a volatile market.

Volatility represents how high/low the price will swing around the mean price.

- Implied volatility measures how volatile the market will be
- Historical volatility measures how price changes over past time periods

## how to measure
- quantify the daily returns (percent move on a daily basis) of the asset.
