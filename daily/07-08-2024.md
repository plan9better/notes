Today i fucked around, im still at kiki's, prob going home tommorow.
Cleaned up the notes some more and went on to reading [[HeadFirstJava.pdf]]
kiki's coming back in about 2h so i'll try to keep going until then.

Also, the investments are going fine, need some more time but its looking good.
just eth that's lagging behind but i shouldve waited more before buying.
